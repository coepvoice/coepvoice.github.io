            <p>Barbro Karlen reincarnation of Anne Frank
We are always fascinated by stories of Reincarnation. Especially children who are reincarnated as they seem to remember amazing details of a past life.
Most people put it down to their child’s imagination. How can anybody really remember a past life? Is it even possible? Surely when we are born we come into the world for the first time, and experience only those memories from birth, childhood then into adulthood. To believe in reincarnation, sometimes we have to change our whole mindset or even faith to do it.</p>
<p>
              <img src="images/image_4.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid">
            </p>
            <p>And talking about faith, what happens if in one life we are Jewish? Then when we are born again, we are possibly a Catholic or even Methodist? What does that mean? So many questions.
Its even harder for the parents. How must they feel knowing that their child is screaming ‘I want my real mother’?
Most times its easy to dismiss the words, putting it down to childish imaginings. But other times, well they can’t be dismissed so easily.
Take the case of Barbro Karlen. She claims that in a previous life she was in fact, Anne Frank.</p>
            <!--<p>

            </p>-->
            <p>Barbro Karlen was born in Sweden in 1954. Her first book was published at the tender age of 12. It was a book of poetry. The book has gone on to be one of the most popular books in Sweden.
Since then she has written and published nine further volumes of poetry and prose. She has also worked as a mounted policewoman, and trained and competed in dressage for many years.
But it’s her early life that is most startling. Ever since she was a small child she dreamed of another life. The fear would over come her and she would wake up shaking and frightened. She had the horrible dreams for as long as she could remember.
The most startling thing began when she was about two years old. She told her mother and father that her name was not Barbro, it was in fact Anne.
Her mother dismissed it as just a fantasy.
Barbro carried on having the dreams, and couldn’t understand why she felt she was living in two worlds.
By this time she knew that her name was Anne Frank, and couldn’t understand why they kept calling her Barbro. She realized that they were not her real parents even though they insisted that they were.
Barbro had no one else to talk too, and continued to insist that she wasn’t who they said she was.
At this time the Diary of Anne Frank had only been translated into a few languages. But definitely not Swedish.
There is no actual date of publication in Sweden but its believed to be in the late 1950s.</p>
            <p>Over the years the two lives merged together, and Barbro insisted that her real father was going to come and collect her.
By the time she was six years old, her parents were so concerned that their daughter was ‘crazy’ they decided to take her to see a psychiatrist.
By this time Barbro began to realize that nobody would ever believe her. When she visited the psychiatrist she didn’t tell him her stories. She was afraid that she would be taken away and so she kept quiet.
The psychiatrist informed her parents that she was a normal little girl and not to worry about her. She was happy and just living in a child’s dream world. As other children do, she must have been talking to an imaginary friend. She would soon grow out of it.
But she never did.
She became introverted and decided to keep quiet about it. But the memories did not go away.
At the age of seven, she started school. She was so pleased to realize that now she could read and write. So she secretly started to write down her memories, but after writing them she threw the paper away in case others found it.</p>
            <p>Barbro continued to write. By the time she was about eleven years old, she had written poetry, but she also started to question about reincarnation, where we come from, and where we go.
One day a friend of the family saw some of her work that she had kept and asked her parents if he could show it to someone with the idea of getting it published.
This was her first book called Man on Earth. She was twelve years old.
Barbro hadn’t written anything about her being the reincarnation of Anne Frank at this time, purely because she had started to feel silly, and slightly ashamed to think she had told everyone that she was somebody else.
The reason was that after she had started school Barbro realized that Anne Frank was a real person! The book had been published in 1947 but was only then beginning to become popular.
Barbro realized that it was no longer smart to go around saying that she had been Anne Frank.</p>
            <p>At the age of ten, Barbro was taken on a trip to Europe by her parents. Soon they came to Amsterdam, and her parents decided to take in all the sights, and of course one of these was the house of Anne Frank.
After calling for a cab, Barbro suddenly turned around to them and said ‘We don’t need a cab, I know exactly where we are, and how to get to the house’!
Her parents were startled, and replied ‘How do you know this? We have never been here before?’
But Barbro just turned to them and quietly replied ‘ Let me show you the way’.
Her parents didn’t know what to think, but they said okay, and they started to walk to the house.
Crossing roads, turning corners, until Barbro said ‘Its just around the next corner’.
And she was right. As they entered the house, Barbro was heard to say, ‘they have changed the steps outside’!
Her parents didn’t know what to say, but as they entered the house Barbro began to get a really horrible feeling. This was her dream. The atmosphere was clingy, she felt a tightness in her chest. Total and undeniable fear.
The dreams were suddenly real, and right in front of her. They entered the room where Anne Frank had lived. Barbro was terrified, her hands were cold and clammy, and her mother believed that she was ill. She wanted to take her outside, but Barbro said no.
She wanted to see it. To make sure everything was the same that she remembered, but the feelings were getting worse.
She noticed that Anne Franks pictures were still on the wall, and she excitedly told her parents, ‘Look the pictures are still there’!
But there were no pictures there.
‘What are you talking about?’ Her mother asked. ‘The pictures were there, I know they were’ Barbo replied.
So her mother walked over to one of the men who worked there and asked if there had been pictures on the wall. The man replied, yes. They had taken them down because people were taking them.
Then her mother realised that it was real. Everything Barbro had said was true. She hugged her and told her that, now she understood. ‘You are not alone anymore’.
Barbro decided to wait outside. On the way to the front door she suddenly saw a man in a green uniform standing over her.
She cried, and ran, only to fall over the step. When she turned round he was gone. In fact he had never been there in the first place. It was a flash back.
Barbro’s mother went on to become a spiritual Church goer. Her father dismissed it all purely because he didn’t want anything to shake his safe world.
</p>
<p>We all know the story of Anne Frank. A young German Jewish girl thrown into the horrors of War at a young age, forced to stay hidden away in an attic at her fathers work place in Amsterdam.
Along with her family on this 6th July 1942 Annelies Marie Frank, or Anne Frank started her captivity.
The small area was cramped and claustrophobic. Living in such abysmal conditions, Anne found her freedom by writing in a diary her father had bought on her 13th Birthday. Throughout their hidden years she captured each emotion, girlish thought and fear, writing it down purely to keep herself busy.
Little did she know that years after her death in a Concentration Camp, her Diary would become the second biggest best seller book after the Bible.
She died after being betrayed by one of their helpers, and on the morning of the 4th August was arrested and transferred with her sister Margot to the hell hole that was Bergen Belsen
Otto Frank, their father was the only member of the family to survive. A few years after the war he returned to Amsterdam and met Miep Gies, one of the kind people who helped hide the family, and who had found the diary in the attic.
After many months of contemplation he decided to publish it so that people could read the true story of their suffering at the hands of the Nazi’s. Little did he know just how popular the book would be.
Anne Frank ironically died just a few weeks before the liberation of Bergen Belsen, around 15th April 1945, possibly from Typhus, but the real cause was never known. She had been at the camp less than a year.
The first publication of Anne Frank’s Diary was on June 25th 1947. The Title of the book is actually called Anne Frank: The Diary Of A Young Girl.</p>

<p>The most compelling proof has to be the fact that Barbro has actually met and talked to Anne Frank’s Cousin Buddy Elias.
Buddy is an actor, who has starred in The Love Boat, Crime Scene and The Magic Mountain. He is also the last living relative of Anne Frank.
He had heard about Barbro through her publisher. Even though at that time she hadn’t written her story.
Buddy was intrigued and asked to meet her. Even though he didn’t believe in reincarnation. But he was curious to see who this woman was going around telling everybody that she was in fact Anne Frank.
He invited her to dinner. As Barbro knocked on the door, Buddy came out and they looked at each other. Then they fell into each others arms.
They both cried.
They sat for two hours and talked and she realized that Buddy was the President of Anne Franks Foundation. This put him in a very vulnerable position, he wasn’t sure how the other members would react to the story.
When the newspapers asked him, ‘Do you believe that Barbo is the reincarnation of Anne Frank’?
He answered ‘Yes’.
Since then Buddy has been hounded by the press to such an extent that he has now backed away from interviews, but keeps in touch with Barbro once a week, and she stays with him when she visits Switzerland.
The more I research these reincarnation cases, the more I believe they are true. Unless Barbro’s mother or father got their hands on a copy of Anne Frank’s Diary and read the whole book to her before the age of two years old, there cannot be another explanation.
Unless of course it was shown on TV. But back then TV stations were still in their early days of broadcasting. Even so, would a small child of two years old really take in all that information?
I doubt it. So, do I believe her? Yes I do.</p>
